# MPG Predictor App

### A simple interactive Shiny app  
Predict car fuel efficiency based on weight and horsepower.

Created as part of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization  
**Developing Data Products â€“ Week 4**

## What the App Does

- Built using R Shiny  
- Uses the built-in `mtcars` dataset  
- Predicts **Miles per Gallon (MPG)**  
- Displays both numeric prediction and visual plot  
- User-friendly interface

## How It Works

- Linear regression model trained on mtcars:

```{r}
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars)
summary(model)$coefficients
User inputs weight and horsepower

App predicts MPG and displays result interactively
